-File Architecture
    -Multiple small Files with purpose
    -Identify patterns
    -Rules for class names and CSS Selectors
    - Names with _ informs others that this files will be imported
    - Tom import those files use gulp css import (npm install gulp-cssimport)
        -The import should be in the very beginning of the css files

-Design patterns
    -Use the BEM principles
        -Block -> Independent reusable part or our design (E.g.: .main-div)
        -Element -> Belongs to the block. It cannot be used outside the block(.main-div__title). To indicate
    an Element in BEM we use __
        -Modifier -> Can be used in a block or element to indicate a change to the default state of an object
        (.main-div__title--orange). To indicate a modifier in BEM we use --
        -CSS selectors should target elements with classes (elements are free in the document)
        -Blocks can be nested dinside other blocks.
        -Identify pattterns and then create single-responsibility blocks
        -Makes the relationship between HTML and CSS clear
    -Text not bigger than 1200px width
